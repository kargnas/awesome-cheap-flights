The title should be with type and scope. content is list of edits but minimum. do not use bold ('**'), you must write the commit message. The title should be super concise. (2) combine the feature changes if the file is more than 5 files. for example, if you have a lot changes because you bumped tailwindcss v3 to v4, you just write you bumped tailwindcss 4 from 3. (3) the maximum list is 5. if it's exceed, you need to combine some common changes like I mentioned at (2). (4) don't mention change details about auto-generated file like pnpm-lock.yaml. (5) NEVER use '【' and '】'",
